# onlineVotingSystem
This project is an online voting system designed for the MBSTU CSE Alumni Association Election 2025-2026. It allows alumni to log in with their alumni ID and password, with an OTP email verification step for added security, while admin users log in directly. Voters can cast one vote per position, and candidate images are displayed alongside their names. The system includes modules for managing candidates and voters, as well as for viewing election results. Built using PHP, MySQL (via XAMPP), and Bootstrap, the application offers a responsive and user-friendly interface for the entire voting process
